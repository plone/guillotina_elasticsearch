Elasticsearch integration for guillotina.


Configuration
-------------

config.json can include elasticsearch section::

    "elasticsearch": {
        "index_name_prefix": "guillotina-",
        "connection_settings": {
            "endpoints": ["localhost:9200"],
            "sniffer_timeout": 0.5
        }
    }


Installation on a site
----------------------

POST SITE_URL/@catalog

{}

Uninstall on a site
-------------------

DELETE SITE_URL/@catalog

{}


Migrate Command
---------------

`guillotina_elasticsearch` comes with a `es-migrate` guillotina command::

    ./bin/g es-migrate


This command will perform a live migration on the index. It does this by
performing the reindex on a new index while the other one is still active.

New index and delete requests are performed on both indexes during live migration.

It is also smart about how to migrate, doing a diff on the mapping and only
reindexing the fields that changed.
